# Pokemon-Search-app

The Pokémon Search Application enables users to locate Pokémon by inputting either a name or an identification number. Once the search button is activated, the application presents details such as the Pokémon's name, ID, weight, height, statistics, types, and an accompanying image. At present, the application accommodates two Pokémon, namely Pikachu and Gengar, and it notifies the user if the entered information does not correspond to any available Pokémon.
